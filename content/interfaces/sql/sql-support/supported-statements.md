## Transactional statements

Transactional semantics are a work in progress. Dolt isn't like other databases: a "commit" in dolt creates a new entry in the repository revision graph, as opposed to updating one or more rows atomically as in other databases. By default, updating data through SQL statements modifies the working set of the repository. Committing changes to the repository requires the use of `dolt add` and `dolt commmit` from the command line. But it's also possible for advanced users to create commits and branches directly through SQL statements.

Not much work has been put into supporting the true transaction and concurrency primitives necessary to be an application server, but limited support for transactions does exist. Specifically, when running the SQL server with `@@autocommit = false`, the working set will not be updated with changes until a `COMMIT` statement is executed.

| Statement | Supported | Notes and limitations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `BEGIN` | O | `BEGIN` parses correctly, but is a no-op: it doesn't create a checkpoint that can be returned to with `ROLLBACK`. |
| `COMMIT` | ✓ | `COMMIT` will write any pending changes to the working set when `@@autocommit = false` |
| `COMMIT(MESSAGE)` | ✓ | The `COMMIT()` function creates a commit of the current database state and returns the hash of this new commit. See [concurrency](../concurrency.md) for details. |
| `LOCK TABLES` | X | `LOCK TABLES` parses correctly but does not prevent access to those tables from other sessions. |
| `ROLLBACK` | X | `ROLLBACK` parses correctly but is a no-op. |
| `SAVEPOINT` | X |  |
| `RELEASE SAVEPOINT` | X |  |
| `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` | X |  |
| `SET @@autocommit = 1` | ✓ | When `@@autocommit = true`, changes to data will update the working set after every statement. When `@@autocommit = false`, the working set will only be updated after `COMMIT` statements. |
| `SET TRANSACTION` | X | Different isolation levels are not yet supported. |
| `START TRANSACTION` | O | `START TRANSACTION` parses correctly, but is a no-op: it doesn't create a checkpoint that can be returned to with `ROLLBACK`. |
| `UNLOCK TABLES` | ✓ | `UNLOCK TABLES` parses correctly, but since `LOCK TABLES` doesn't prevent concurrent access it's essentially a no-op. |

## Prepared statements

| Statement | Supported | Notes and limitations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PREPARE` | ✓ |  |
| `EXECUTE` | ✓ |  |

## Access management statements

Access management via SQL statements is not yet supported. This table will be updated as access management features are implemented. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues) if lack of SQL access management is blocking your use of Dolt, and we will prioritize accordingly.

A root user name and password can be specified in the config for [`sql-server`](../../cli.md#dolt-sql-server). This user has full privileges on the running database.

| Statement | Supported | Notes and limitations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ALTER USER` | X |  |
| `CREATE ROLE` | X |  |
| `CREATE USER` | X |  |
| `DROP ROLE` | X |  |
| `DROP USER` | X |  |
| `GRANT` | X |  |
| `RENAME USER` | X |  |
| `REVOKE` | X |  |
| `SET DEFAULT ROLE` | X |  |
| `SET PASSWORD` | X |  |
| `SET ROLE` | X |  |

## Session management statements

| Statement | Supported | Notes and limitations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SET` | ✓ |  |
| `SET CHARACTER SET` | O | \`SET CHARACTER SET\` parses correctly, but Dolt supports only the \`utf8mb4\` collation |
| `SET NAMES` | O | \`SET NAMES\` parses correctly, but Dolt supports only the \`utf8mb4\` collation for identifiers |
| `KILL QUERY` | ✓ |  |

## Utility statements

| Statement | Supported | Notes and limitations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EXPLAIN` | ✓ |  |
