title: Turbine + Dolt
---

## Turbine
Turbine is a drug discovery startup creating computer simulations of cancer cells as a mechanism for drug discovery, and pinpoint which kinds of cells would be most sensitive to these discoveries.

Turbineâ€™s technology revolves around the Simulated Cell, a continuously evolving computer simulation of human cancer cells. Tens of billions of such simulations are run at each screening in fleets of cloud GPUs, trying to find new drug targets in the newest release of the cell model.

## The Problem

A Simulated Cell is assembled from lot of different types of data, including, but not limited to:
- protein-protein interactions
- drug sensitivity
- genomics

As these data are updated, those changes need to be incorporated into the Simulated Cell. Naturally changes need to be tested first. On top of evolving underlying cell model, there is enrichment extracted from evolving literature. This data is provided by contract biologists, who need to input and test their changes to the Simulated Cell model.

Finally, a drug discovery project can last for many months during which time the Simulated Cell will have evolved. This however makes experiments hard, as changes to the drug need to be compared "apples to apples", and so historical versions of the Simulated Cell need to be available to researchers.

## Discovering Dolt
The Turbine team had initially implemented something in Mongo DB. Mongo DB has the advantage of accommodating arbitrary JSON, and it's not too hard to version those objects. However, as the model grew and the structure become clearer the Mongo based solution become intractable. Some core issues were lack of robust typing and performance on foreign keys.

At the same time the workflow around updating the Simulated Cell, soliciting enrichment from researchers, and testing experiment against "versions" of the core model was eerily reminiscent of Git. A quick Google search yielded the following Slack conversation:

This happened 31st of March, 2020. The team immediately took Dolt for a spin, but unfortunately they hit a snag:

At the time DoltHub had not "Contact Us" form, though you can now [Contact Us](https://www.dolthub.com/contact). Thankfully Kristof did some digging and found an email address. It turned out to be a relatively superficial bug, and after several meetings we realized Dolt and Turbine agreed to a partnership.
